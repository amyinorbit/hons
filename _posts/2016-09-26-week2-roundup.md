The main goal those past two weeks was to work on getting the project's aim and
objectives down, and start working on the research question. My working title
for the project is **"Designing a standard communications platform for Low-cost
space applications"**.

*Project Aim*:

"Evaluate, design and implement and a low-cost platform for intra-payload and
long-range radio communications for High-Altitude balloons"

*Objectives*:


* Evaluate existing platforms & protocols used for communications between
  payloads and over radio in high-altitude balloons and low-cost space
  applications (CubeSat class nano-satellites)
  
* Evaluate the feasibility of a generalised High-Altitude Balloon bus based on
  low-cost, open-source, off-the-shelf hardware
  
* Design the required protocols and build a prototype for an open-source
  high-altitude balloon flight computer and communication platform.
  
*Research Question*:

I'm not happy with it so far (at all) â€” the yes/no answer is a fairly obvious
red flag, but the research question I've come up with so far is:

"Can a low-cost, generalised intra-payload and radio communication platform be
designed to facilitate the implementation of High-Altitude Balloon scientific
missions?"

## Next Week

Next week, I need to focus on my research question and gathering good context 
and background reading to prepare for the literature review and the proposal in
general.

On the experiments side, I want to try and setup a basic radio link, for the
moment with existing protocols (probably RTTY and SSDV).

## Reading List

I've focused my research this week on data and communication buses designed for
small satellites (usually CubeSat class):

 * Aalborg University StudentSatellite. 2001.
   [*The CubeSat Internal bus: The I2C*][1].
 
 * Volstad, M. 2011. [*Internal Data Bus of a Small Student Satellite*][2].
   Norwegian University of Science and Technology
   
 * Eatchel, A. L. et al. 2002. [*Development of a Baseline Telemetry System for
   the Cubesat Program at the University of Arizona*][3]. University of Arizona.
