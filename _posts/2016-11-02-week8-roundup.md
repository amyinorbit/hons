title: Week 8 Roundup: Supervisor Meeting

This week was my first meeting with Ian as my official supervisor. Since the
formal project proposal is due in two weeks, we've focused on what should go
into it.

The overall framing of the project goes a bit like that so far:

 * High Altitude Balloons allow cheap-ish high-altitude research.
 * Single-purpose designs require CompSci knowledge and re-writing software
   that's nearly identical to all missions.
 * Satellite industry revolves around the use of a bus-payload model where
   missions are based on standard platforms + custom payloads plugged on.
 * Applying the same model to High-Altitude balloons could make missions more
   accessible, both in terms of price and knowledge required.

The literature review is well underway. I've found papers describing
communication systems used in multi-million-dollar satellite buses and on
students cubesats. The papers from CCSDS are a good example of packet and frame
design for high latency, low reliability data links.
