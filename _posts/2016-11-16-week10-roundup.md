Last week I've submitted the formal project proposal [[pdf file][1]]. it went
pretty well since Ian wanted us to go over it a few days before deadline, which
meant I was ready in time. Now that this is done, I've planned what I want to
do in the next few weeks, before the holiday break. This was also a good way to 
decide what could go in the feasibility demo planned for week 13:

 * Have another look at the overall systems architecture, and potentially start
   working on a software architecture for AHABus.
  
 * Start working on the frame/packet format designs.
