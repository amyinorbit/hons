My goal this week was to get the most basic radio communications setup working:
Arduino or Raspberry Pi at one end, transmitting data (text and images) to a
computer acting as the ground station.

Because of frequencies and power limitations in the UK, the module I've used so
far is the [Radiometrix NTX2B][1]. The module operates in the 434.75 MHz band at
10 mW, which is one of the few bands that can be used for airborne transmission
in the UK.

## PWM vs. Voltage Divider

The first version of the circuit used one of the Arduino PWM pins, to apply
two different levels of voltage to the NTX2B (logical 0 and 1).

This solution has two main problems:

 * Applying a given voltage is done through PWM, which means the pin oscillates
   fast between 0V and 5V. This could potentially introduce perturbations in
   the RF frequency.
   
 * Raspberry Pis don't have a real-time clock, and thus can't generate a precise
   PWM signal on GPIO pins.

By using a voltage divider on the TXD pin instead, I can use a digital pin.
The voltage divider will convert the logic levels (0V and 3.3V/5V) to two
voltages determined by the three resistors' values. With two 4.7kΩ resistors
and a 43kΩ to the Arduino pin, logical 0 yields 2.37V, logical 1 yields 2.63V.
The 0.26V shift gives a ~520Hz frequency shift.

| 5.0V      | 4.7kΩ     | 4.7kΩ     | 43kΩ      | 0.26v     | 518Hz     |

## RTTY

The AVR code is fairly basic: for each bit sent to the radio, the radio pin is
pulled low or high, and then the programme waits a set amount of time before
sending the next bit. Each sequence of eight bits is preceded by a start bit (0)
and followed by two stop bits (1). When no data is being transmitted, the line
is held high.

    :::c
    #include <util/delay.h>
    #include <avr/io.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdint.h>

    #define RADIO_PIN 5         // PORTB[5] -> pin 13

    // Write a single bit to the radio
    void rtty_write_bit(char b) {
        // Check only the LSB
        if(b & 0x01) {
            PORTB |= 1 << RADIO_PIN;
        } else {
            PORTB &= ~(1 << RADIO_PIN);
        }
        _delay_us(3370);        // ~1000000/300 - time for logic
    }

    void rtty_write(char c) {
        rtty_write_bit(0);      // Start bit

        for(uint8_t i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
            rtty_write_bit(c);
            c = c >> 1;         // shift the LSB away
        }
        rtty_write_bit(1);      // Stop bit 1
        rtty_write_bit(1);      // Stop bit 2
    }

    void main(void) {

        // Set TXD as output, pull high
        DDRB |= 1 << RADIO_PIN;
        PORTB |= 1 << RADIO_PIN;
        const char* message = "RTTY TEST BEACON\n";

        // Main run loop
        for(;;) {
            // Copy the message pointer and send each character until
            // a null byte is found
            const char* cptr = message;
            while(*cptr != '\0') {
                rtty_write(*cptr++);
            }
            _delay_ms(2000);    // 2 seconds between messages.
        }
    }

Once the radio module is wired and the Arduino transmitting, the reception uses
a £10 Software-Defined Radio receiver, which output is sent to [GQRX][2]. Once
the tuning is done in GQRX, the audio output is sent to [dl-fldigi][3] through
[Soundflower][4].

I used the exact same code to send images after encoding them to [SSDV][5].
I used the `xxd` BSD tool to export the binary data as a `uint8_t` array, which
the AVR can then read and transmit, one byte at a time. SSDV works fairly well
(it divides images in 256-byte packets with its own error correction code) but
can take a few minutes for even small images — at 300bps, there isn't really
anything that can be done.

## Raspberry Pi

Because Raspbian (based on Debian Linux) is not a real-time OS, I couldn't rely
on the system's clock to generate valid 50 or 300bps RTTY signals from the Pi.
The solution is to use the Serial/UART chip to do it: RTTY with 8 bit, no parity
bits and two stop bits uses exactly the same pulse train as UART 8N2.

The voltage divider is connected to the UART Tx pin on the Pi, and the C code
is exactly the same as if I were talking to a serial device.

    :::c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <fcntl.h>
    #include <termios.h>
    #include <stdint.h>
    #include <stddef.h>
    #include <string.h>

    typedef uint8_t byte_t;
    static const char* string = "RTTY TEST BEACON\n";

    int main(int argc, const char** argv) {
        int stream = -1;

        // Open a file descriptor to the serial port
        stream = open("/dev/ttyAMA0", O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY/*i | O_NDELAY*/);
        if(stream < 0) {
            fprintf(stderr, "unable to open serial connection");
        }
    
        // configure the serial reader
        struct termios options;
        tcgetattr(stream, &options);
        // 300bps, 8 bits, 2 stop bits
        options.c_cflag = B300 | CS8 | CSTOPB | CLOCAL | CREAD;
        options.c_iflag = IGNPAR;
        options.c_oflag = 0;
        options.c_lflag = 0;
        tcflush(stream, TCIFLUSH);
        tcsetattr(stream, TCSANOW, &options);
    
        // Send the string every 5 second
        while(1) {
            write(stream, string, strlen(string));
            sleep(5);
        }
    
        close(stream);
        return 0;
    }

## Debriefing

I now have a working RTTY transmitter. On the AVR version, there is one major
flaw: since the transmission rate is generated by delays (busy wait loops), the
programme blocks until every byte has been sent. Since images can take upwards
of five minutes to send, that's not acceptable. So this week, my goal is to work
around that by using timers interrupts.
